A password manager with login and registration that uses passkeys, Windows Hello, macOS TouchID or email verification to store passwords in the cloud with ease

My goal with this is to make Password saving effortless and easy, without the fear of getting All account hacket with the minimal savty of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera/Opera GX or Brave

To use it:
    Windows:
        Test the all round package: (coming soon)
        Run server localy: Run the ´´´run-server.bat´´´
        Run only the App: Run the ´´´run-app.bat´´´
        To build it: (coming soon)
    MacOs/Linux:
        coming soon
    All systems:
        Run server localy: Run the ´´´node server.js´´´
        Run only the App: Run ´´´npx electron . ´´´
        To build it: (coming soon)



Whwn the Project is ready for the first public deployment and goes in version 1.0, I will manage the servers and databases


Things to do before the First closed deployment/alpha version:
    - Get Passkeys working to register/login
    - Database saves the Acounts with their passkeys
    - Get a name For the Passwormanager
